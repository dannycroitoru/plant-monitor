# Smart Plant Monitoring System

An Arduino-based project that monitors soil moisture levels and alerts the user when a plant needs watering.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- 16x2 LCD Screen
- LED
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires

## How It Works
The system reads analog data from the soil moisture sensor, calculates a percentage, and displays it on the LCD. A red LED lights up when the moisture level drops below a certain threshold.

## Project Management
This project was managed using Agile methodology in Jira. See user stories and backlog in the project documentation.
